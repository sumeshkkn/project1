I've been living inside this cardboard box down the end of the street that you live in
I've been living inside this cardboard box down the end of the street that you live in
And I don't wanna see you cry no more
Don't wanna see you cry no more
Said I can't live to see you cry no more
Don't wanna see you cry no more
Saw the morning break the trees and the leaves from the sky
The little green bug it flew in my eye
Cause I couldn't wait to see you and climb through your window
When your dad stayed up drinking and I did a lot of thinking bout this whole crazy deal it's just too unreal I'd like to run away to a place far away hey lady come on baby
I've been living inside this cardboard box down the end of the street that you live in
I've been living inside this cardboard box down the end of the street that you live in
And I don't wanna see you cry no more
Don't wanna see you cry no more
No I can't live to see you cry no more
Don't wanna see you cry no more
I've been living inside this cardboard box down the end of the street that you live in
I've been living inside this cardboard box down the end of the street that you live in
And I don't wanna see you cry no more
Don't wanna see you cry no more
No I can't live to see you cry no more
Don't wanna see you cry no more
I've been living inside this cardboard box
Don't wanna see you cry no more
I've been living inside this cardboard box
Don't wanna see you cry no more
